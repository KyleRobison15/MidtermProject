		<h1 class="display-5">The thirst quenching, social beer app</h1>

		<h5>brewBuds is a social web application for beer lovers. Both
			die-hard beer connoisseurs and casual beer drinkers alike can view
			and rate beers that have been posted to the site.</h5>

		<h1 class="display-5">User Rating System</h1>

		<h5>A key feature of the brewBuds app is the ability for users to
			gain reputation by adding new beers. Once a beer has been added, that
			beer gets assigned to the user who added it and other users can now
			post reviews about that beer and rate it. A user's rating is then
			based on the average ratings of all the beers they have posted. Users
			also have what we call "Merit" which is the total number of ratings
			all their beers have received. In other words, the higher a user's
			merit, the more credible their rating. Lastly, users earn better
			badges as their rating improves and they progress through the
			brewBuds ranks - Apprentice (0 - 0.99 rating), Shift Brewer (1 - 1.99
			rating), Production Brewer (2 - 2.99 rating), Head Brewer (3 - 3.99
			rating) and Brew Master (4 - 5 rating).</h5>

		<h1 class="display-5">For the casual beer drinkers</h1>

		<h5>More casual beer drinkers can use the app to simply find beers
			to try. Each beer has a comprehensive profile that shows its
			description and several other details such as the beer's brewery,
			bitterness (IBU), color, and overall rating. When a user tries a
			beer, they can post a review, give it a rating and add it to their
			favorites list if they enjoyed it. Users can later revisit their
			review, and update or delete it. Breweries also gain reputation based
			on the average rating of the beers that have been posted by brewBuds
			users. This allows users to find better beers by searching for
			breweries with a high rating.</h5>

		<h1 class="display-5">User Profiles</h1>

		<h5>Each registered user has a public brewBuds profile that shows
			the list of beers they've added and their brewBuds ranking. Users can
			then view other user profiles allowing them to see the beers those
			users have added. This allows users to identify other profiles that
			have a high brewBuds ranking in order to find more delicious beers to
			try. Users can also customize their account by changing their profile
			photo and account details.</h5>
