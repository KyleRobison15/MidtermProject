## Application Overview
brewBuds is a social app for beer lovers. Both die-hard beer connoisseurs and casual beer drinkers can view and rate beers that have been posted to the site.

A key feature is the ability for users to gain reputation by adding new beers. Once a beer has been added, that beer gets assigned to the user who added it and other users can now rate it.
A user's rating is then based on the average ratings of the beers they posted. Users also have what we call "Merit" which is the number of ratings a particular beer has received.
Lastly, users earn better badges as their rating improves and they progress through the brewBuds ranks - Apprentice, Shift Brewer, Production Brewer, Head Brewer and Brew Master.

More casual beer drinkers can use the app to simply find beers to try. Each beer has a comprehensive profile that shows its description and several other details such as the beer's brewery, bitterness (IBU), color, and overall rating. When a user tries a beer, they can post a review, give it a rating and add it to their favorites list if they enjoyed it. Users can later revisit their review, and update or delete it. Breweries also gain reputation based on the average rating of the beers that have been posted by brewBuds users. This allows users to find better beers by searching for breweries with a high rating.

Each registered user has a public brewBuds profile that shows the list of beers they've added and their brewBuds ranking. Users can then view other user profiles allowing them to see the beers those users have added. This allows users to identify other profiles that have a high brewBuds ranking in order to find more delicious beers to try. Users can also customize their account by changing their profile photo and account details.
